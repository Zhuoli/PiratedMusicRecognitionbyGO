File matching
=========================
## The purpose of this project is to build a application used to find the most similiar file in your laptop. The definition of "similiar" is not just compare files bite by bite but extracting the features of each file based on the file format and compare these features. 

## The first goal is to find the similiar audio files given a source audio file, here "similiar" means these two audio files should sounds the same by humans' ears.
